# DBSCAN vs K-Means Clustering

This project compares the performance of **DBSCAN** and **K-Means** clustering algorithms on three datasets:
1. **Synthetic Blobs dataset** (from sklearn `make_blobs`)
2. **Moons dataset** (from sklearn `make_moons`)
3. **Mall Customers dataset** (real-world dataset)
